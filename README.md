My website is about fashion tips. It has 5 pages, the first one is the homepage. In the homepage (index.html), it displays an introduction about fashion, some model images, navigation buttons, and my website logo. For the banner, I use a bootstrap4 carousel. Next, style page (styles.html), as usual, it includes navigation buttons, logo, and images for style examples. 
 
In tips page (tips.html), I make table content for my tips page for looking tidy and neat. Some images for example, navigation buttons, and my website logo. The fourth page is about us (aboutus.html), I have my own biodata on this page and I used the unordered list to make my biodata list. For my website history, I use the boostrap4 column. 
 
Lastly, the video page (video.html) has some videos for more information about tips and styles.
